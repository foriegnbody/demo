This file is compiler generated and is placed in 'listing' directory.
This file provides the information (meta-data) needed to
relate a VSAM file's record layout to the SQL table name and column names. The information
needed to relate an SQL column to an elementary data item in a VSAM record layout is
declared in a column element such as:
<column name="ttldo" offset="36" length="4" usage="32" sqltype="A" table="ACCTFIL"/>
The name of the SQL column is "ttldo". Usage 32 and length 4 mean CHAR(4). This column belongs
in SQL table ACCTFIL. All table attributes in this file must be identical including case.
The COBOL name of this elementary data item is unknown. The data item is located at byte
number 36 from the start of the record layout; byte zero is at the start of the record. This
data item is 4 bytes long.
The generation of this file is controlled by compiler directive $XFD.
So to generate this file, put a "$XFD" compiler directive
just above the ACCTREC record definition, like this in your-COBOL-CICS-or-VSAM-PROGRAM.cbl:

Example in your-cobol-VSAM-program.cbl:

$XFD FILE="ACCTFIL.xml"
01 ACCTREC.   | Begins VSAM file layout 
   02 ACCTID         PIC X(5).  | KEY FIELD 
   05 NAME.                     | ALTERNATE KEY 
      10 LAST-NAME   PIC X(18). 
      10 FIRST-NAME  PIC X(12). 
   05 ADDRESS        PIC X(25). 
     . . .

EXEC CICS READ DATASET('ACCTFIL') RIDFLD(ACCTC) INTO(ACCTREC) END-EXEC. 
     . . .

The '$' symbol must be in the indicator column, which is the same column where you put 
an '*' to indicate a comment line. Save and re-compile the program. You should see ACCTFIL.xml 
in 'listing' directory. Note that 'ACCTFIL' is uppercase. This is because 'ACCTFIL' is the name of 
the SQL table; Oracle names are case sensitive. 

Copy this file from 'listing' directory to 'resources' directory. Now you may, if you wish, rename 
this file to any name ending in *.xml; this name is case sensitive. 
You must specify the name of this file in file 'project-etp_deploy_settings' of the ETP Deploy Wizard 
project. To do so: double-click on file 'project-etp_deploy_settings' to open the ETP Deploy Wizard 
settings editor; click File Control; click Add; for Source Name, enter the 
the name of the DATASET (also known as FILE), which in the above example is 'acctfil' (without quotes); 
for Destination Name, enter 'jdbc:' concatenated with the name of this file, so for our example, you 
enter 'jdbc:ACCTFIL.xml' (without quotes). Destination name is case sensitive. 
You have just related the VSAM file name used in COBOL programs with the name of this file. 

Now you must hand-edit this file. 

If the SQL column names (in the actual database table) have different names, then 
you must update the name attributes in the column elements to reflect the actual SQL names used. 
Change 'pay1_yyyymmdd' to 'pay1_date', 'pay2_yyyymmdd' to 'pay2_date', and 'pay3_yyyymmdd' to 'pay3_date'. 

In the CICS READ example above, the RIDFLD value is found in the field called ACCTC. 
RIDFLD stands for Record Identifier Field, which is the key key for the file. ACCTC is a field 
that stores the value of the lookup field. By further examining this 
(fictitious) program, you'll discover that ACCTC corresponds to SQL column 'acctid'. 
So you must add the attribute 'ridfld="dup"' to the acctid column element in this file. 
<column name="acctid" offset="0" length="5" usage="32" sqltype="A" table="ACCTFIL" ridfld="dup"/> 

Otherwise, the CICS application would abort with AEIQ, and the web page would dump out a stack trace with error messages: 
    RESP(IOERR=17) RESP2(0) ABCODE(AEIQ) (IOERR) 
    java.sql.SQLException: ORA-00904: "RIDFLD": invalid identifier 

ridfld="dupcheck" vs. ridfld="true": 'dupcheck' means to check for duplicate keys. 
Use 'dupcheck' to emulate IBM CICS processing when DUPKEY condition 
is raised; that is, dfhresp(DUPKEY) is true and EIBRESP = 15. The DUPKEY condition can be 
raised for a READ, READNEXT or READPREV command. You most likely want to use 'dupcheck'. 
Use 'true' if DUPKEY condition is never to be raised by COBOL programs; READ, 
READNEXT and READPREV commands returns NORMAL (i.e., EIBRESP = 0) when reading duplicate 
records. Using 'true' can simplify your COBOL code because usually your COBOL programs would not 
require special processing for duplicate records. 'true' is an Elastic COBOL enhancement. 
ridfld="dupcheck" may be abbreviated to ridfld="dup" or ridfld="d" or ridfld="D". 
ridfld="true" may be abbreviated to ridfld="t" or ridfld="T".
